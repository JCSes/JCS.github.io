### Purpose
This website will serve as an in-depth explanation to why the videogame, The Last of Us 2, became a controversy and has received many negative backlashes from its initial fans.

### Additional Information 
The Last of Us 2 is a post-apocalyptic, action, drama, horror, thriller produced by Naughty Dog which is a sequel to the 2013, award winning videogame, The Last of Us. On December 3, 2016 The Last of Us 2 was first announced at the PlayStation Experience event which triggered an enormous hype across the fanbase. On February 21, 2020, Naughty Dog revealed that it would be released, but later got cancelled due to problems that occurred. However on June 19, 2020 The Last of Us 2 was finally released and millions of people worldwide bought and played it.

Although it seems successful at first, at second it recieved many negative backlashes from its own fans and separated the fanbase into two: the ones that loved it, and the ones that hated it, which formed controversy, and I will tackle on the topic of why other fans hated it.

## The Disrespectful Death of a Beloved Character Controversy
Joel in the first hour of the game, dies in the hands of a new character known as Abby and we later learn that she was the daughter of a doctor that Joel Killed to save Ellie, his non-biological daughter. This made the fans furious, not because Joel died at all, but because the previous situations that led up to this doesn't stay consistent with his character. Joel was known to be uncaring for survivors, untrusting, he doesn't trust survivivors of the pandemic, or atleast in the first The Last of Us, due to an incident that caused his daughter's life years ago. Yet, its sequel ignores this which ultimately lead to his death.
