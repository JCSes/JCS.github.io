# The Last of Us 2- An Infuriating Disappointment

Owned by Jaime Chikko A. Sesgundo from 9 Gonzalez A 

### Purpose
This website will serve as an in-depth explanation to why the videogame, The Last of Us 2, became a controversy and has received many negative backlashes from its initial fans.

### Additional Information 
The Last of Us 2 is a post-apocalyptic, action, drama, horror, thriller produced by Naughty Dog which is a sequel to the 2013, award winning videogame, The Last of Us. On December 3, 2016 The Last of Us 2 was first announced at the PlayStation Experience event which triggered an enormous hype across the fanbase. On February 21, 2020, Naughty Dog revealed that it would be released, but later got cancelled due to problems that occurred. However on June 19, 2020 The Last of Us 2 was finally released and millions of people worldwide bought and played it.

Although it seems successful at first, at second it recieved many negative backlashes from its own fans and separated the fanbase into two: the ones that loved it, and the ones that hated it, which formed controversy, and I will tackle on the topic of why other fans hated it.

## The Death of a Beloved Character Controversy
Joel and his brother, Tommy saves a new character named Abby from a horde of infecteds, later on, Joel dies in the hands of Abby cause we later learn that she did this out of revenge. Abby was the daughter of a doctor that Joel Killed in order to save Ellie, his non-biological daughter. This made the fans furious, not because Joel died at all, but because of his decisions to the previous situations that led up to this doesn't stay consistent with his character. Joel was known to be uncaring for survivors, untrusting, he doesn't trust survivors of the pandemic due to an incident that caused his daughter's life years ago. He would even go as far as running one over rather than risk being betrayed by one. And The Last of Us fans knew this, yet, its sequel ignores this which ultimately lead him to his death. If the story would go on a more realistic route then Joel would have prevented the mistakes he made, thus, prevented his death.

The most daunting realization is that relationship of Joel and Ellie has reached to a full stop. That instead, most of Joelâ€™s appearances and interactions with Ellie mostly will be only limited to flashbacks from thereon.
