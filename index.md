# The Last of Us 2: An Infuriating Disappointment (Gore and Spoilers!)

This site will serve as an in-depth explanation to why the videogame, **The Last of Us 2**, became a controversy and has garnered many negative backlash from its initial fans.

**The Last of Us 2** is a **story-driven, post-apocalyptic, action, drama, horror, thriller** videogame produced by **Naughty Dog** which is a sequel to the 2013, award winning videogame, **The Last of Us**. 
 
On **December 3, 2016 The Last of Us 2** was first announced at the **PlayStation Experience event** which triggered an enormous hype across **The Last of Us** fanbase. On **February 21, 2020, Naughty Dog** revealed that it would be released, but later got cancelled due to problems that occurred. However on **June 19, 2020, The Last of Us 2** was finally released and millions of people worldwide bought and played it.

Although it seemed successful at first, at second it received many negative backlash from its own fans and separated the fanbase into two: the ones that loved it, and the ones that hated it, which formed controversy. And I will tackle on 3 of the many reasons why others hated it.

## Death of a Beloved Character Controversy

_Joel_ and his brother, _Tommy_ saves a new character named _Abby_ from a horde of infecteds, later on, _Joel_ dies in the hands of _Abby_ cause we later learn that she did this out of revenge. _Abby_ was the daughter of a doctor that _Joel_ Killed in order to save _Ellie_, his figurative daughter.

This made people furious, not because _Joel_ died at all, but because of his decisions to the previous situations that led up to this doesn't stay consistent with his character. 

_Joel_ was known to be uncaring for survivors, untrusting, he doesn't trust the survivors of the pandemic due to an incident that caused his biological daughter's life years ago. He would even go as far as running a survivor over rather than risk being betrayed by one. And **The Last of Us** fans knew this, yet, its sequel ignores it which ultimately led him to his death. 

His change in personality rather comes off as forced, many fans view **Naughty Dog's** decision in changing _Joel's_ character as an unfair way to perfectly fit within the plot of the story. If it would have gone on a more realistic and fair route then _Joel_ would have avoided the mistakes he made, thus, prevented his death.

And seeing that _Joel_ has died, fans were suppose to accept the fact that relationship of _Joel_ and _Ellie_ would be discontinued. That instead, most of _Joel’s_ appearances and interactions with _Ellie_ will mostly be only limited to flashbacks from thereon. Which is really daunting and is an exact contrast to the original plot of **The Last of Us** which moreover focuses on their relationship as a figurative family, as a father and daughter.

## The Ending Controversy

For the most part, the controversy revolves around _Ellie_ suddenly letting _Abby_ live despite the journey she's gone through and everyone _Abby_ has killed. _Ellie_ all of a sudden decides to not kill _Abby_ cause of a vision that slipped right in a very convenient moment. Her sudden change in aggression towards _Abby_ due to the vision isn't very well explained, and hasn't been very well established throughout the story which led people to believe that this was just a flaw in writing, an awfully bad one. 

Some fans are simply disappointed that they didn’t get to kill _Abby_ after she killed _Joel_. Which I also agree with and supports the idea that some fans wanted a much more straightforward sequel complemented by a bloody conclusion where **Naughty Dog** unfortunately chose not to deliver. 

The whole moral of the game's story is basically revenge is bad but fails to deliver a message so simple which made its story rather vague.

Other fans also cite that the ending was too depressing and unsatisfying. The last part of the ending shows _Ellie_ walking towards her farm-like home. She soon notices that she got abandoned and attempts to play a song _Joel_ made for her with a guitar to calm herself down. She attempts to play the song but unable to properly do so since her two of her fingers were bitten off by _Abby_ during the fight scene. As she accepts that she can't play the song, she slowly puts down the guitar in a standing position, beside a window upstairs and the camera zooms in on its headstock as _Ellie_ walks out of the barn-like-home then after which the credits roll.

The ending was unnecessarily tragic and  depressing, not only did _Ellie_ got abandoned but she was alone. Her greatest fear was being alone. Many fans were unsatisfied of the ending therefore ended up disliking it. The story doesn't end with a satisfying solution to the problems but only added more problems to the mix.   

## The Abby Controversy

In the game, you get to play as _Abby, Joel's_ killer for about half of the game's campeign. Some fans protest against this because, as said before, she was _Joel's_ murderer. They would even let her die in the game in hopes that it would make a difference to the story.

_Abby_ not only had an athletic and jacked-up body that rivaled most of the game's male characters, but she was also responsible for the death of a significant character only a few hours into the game. This made her an obvious target for the series' fans, and the enmity was heightened when it was revealed that players will spend the most of the game playing as _Abby_ rather than the much-adored _Ellie_.

Others believe that _Abby's_ character falls short. They say that **The Last of Us Part 2** doesn't give them the chance to really care about _Abby's_ Character as they do about _Ellie_, which kind of ruins the concept of witnessing the story from two different perspectives. Similarly, many claim that they were eager to see _Ellie_ and _Joel's_ narrative come to a satisfying close. But instead, resented to having too much time spent on a new character, _Abby_.

All this being said, **The Last of Us 2** built a huge reputation and lost it. The writers of the story in the game were either oblivious or careless to why **The Last of Us** was very well received and adored by its fans, which is the very reason why **The Last of Us 2** didn't live up to most of its fans expectations, thus, was despised by most of them.
