# The Last of Us 2- An Infuriating Disappointment (SPOILERS!)

Owned by Jaime Chikko A. Sesgundo from 9 Gonzalez A

### Purpose

This website will serve as an in-depth explanation to why the videogame, **The Last of Us 2**, became a controversy and has received many negative backlash from its initial fans.

### Additional Information 

**The Last of Us 2** is a story-driven, post-apocalyptic, action, drama, horror, thriller videogame produced by **Naughty Dog** which is a sequel to the 2013, award winning videogame, **The Last of Us**. 

On December 3, 2016 **The Last of Us 2** was first announced at the **PlayStation Experience event** which triggered an enormous hype across **The Last of Us** fanbase. On February 21, 2020, **Naughty Dog** revealed that it would be released, but later got cancelled due to problems that occurred. However on June 19, 2020 **The Last of Us 2** was finally released and millions of people worldwide bought and played it.

Although it seems successful at first, at second it recieved many negative backlash from its own fans and it separated the fanbase into two: the ones that loved it, and the ones that hated it, which formed controversy, and I will tackle on the topic of why other fans hated it.

## The Death of a Beloved Character Controversy

_Joel_ and his brother, _Tommy_ saves a new character named _Abby_ from a horde of infecteds, later on, _Joel_ dies in the hands of Abby cause we later learn that she did this out of revenge. _Abby_ was the daughter of a doctor that _Joel_ Killed in order to save _Ellie_, his non-biological daughter.

This made the fans furious, not because _Joel_ died at all, but because of his decisions to the previous situations that led up to this doesn't stay consistent with his character. 

_Joel_ was known to be uncaring for survivors, untrusting, he doesn't trust survivors of the pandemic due to an incident that caused his biological daughter's life years ago. He would even go as far as running one over rather than risk being betrayed by one. And **The Last of Us** fans knew this, yet, its sequel ignores this which ultimately led him to his death. 

If the story would go on a more realistic route then _Joel_ would have prevented the mistakes he made, thus, prevented his death.

The most daunting realization is that relationship of _Joel_ and _Ellie_ has reached to a full stop. That instead, most of _Joel’s_ appearances and interactions with _Ellie_ will mostly be only limited to flashbacks from thereon.


## The Ending Controversy

For the most part, the controversy revolves around _Ellie_ suddenly letting _Abby_ live despite the journey she's gone through and everyone _Abby_ has killed. A huge flaw in writing is shown when _Ellie_ all of a sudden decides not to kill _Abby_ just cause of a vision that slipped right in a very convenient moment. _Ellie's_ sudden change in anger towards _Abby_ isn't very well explained, which led people to believe that this was just a flaw in writing, a very bad one. 

Some fans are simply disappointed that they didn’t get to kill _Abby_ after she killed _Joel_, which I also agree with and supports the idea that some fans wanted a much more straightforward sequel complemented by a bloody conclusion where unfortunately Naughty Dog failed to deliver. 

The whole moral of the game's story is basically revenge is bad but fails to deliver a message so simple that it makes the story rather vague.
